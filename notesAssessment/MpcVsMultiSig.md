### MPC versus Multi-Signature Implementations

Elliptic curve can support most blockchain networks
- MPC makes our lives easier
- Signing is one

There are so many signature schemes, TSS, BLS, Schnorr
- Using Multi-signature wallets very complicated
- Bitgo supports TSS and BLS

MPC has universal composability

BitGo is more open than Fireblocks
- Bitgo Enterprise is geared towards compliance, signing and creating txns are open
- More open the more secure, we can contribute to the betterment of the codebase

Bitgo API structure is cumbersome and the code is

Schnorr each signature needs a random number and a hash, it could be a problem because there are not good random number generator
TSS are individual signatures, they are not aggregated
BLS

Schnorr has batch verification
